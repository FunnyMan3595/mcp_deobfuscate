MCP Deobfuscate is a general-purpose obfucation and deobfuscation tool.  It
accepts RetroGuard-style configuration files, and can process anything from
single class files up to multiple .jar files seamlessly, without needing any
of the target's dependencies.

Importantly, this means that it's possible to only process the files which have
changed since MCP Deobfuscate was last run, one project within an environment,
or a single interesting file.  When building against a large codebase, this can
be a massive time savings, especially as part of a test->modify->rebuild loop.
