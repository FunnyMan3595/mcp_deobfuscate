MCP Deobfuscate is a renaming tool suitable for obfuscation and deobfuscation
of Java class files, and jar/zip bundles thereof.  It was written with the
Minecraft Coder Pack in mind (hence the name), but should be sufficiently
general for any use.

MCP Deobfuscate is released under the MIT License, see LICENSE for details.



COMPILING:

With Maven installed, compiling should be as simple as:

mvn clean package



DEPENDENCIES:

To run MCP Deobfuscate, you will need the following libraries in the main MCPD
directory:

* asm-all-3.3.1.jar 
* jcommander-1.29.jar


These files will have been downloaded by Maven, and may be found in the
following locations for Linux users:

~/.m2/repository/asm/asm-all/3.3.1/asm-all-3.3.1.jar
~/.m2/repository/com/beust/jcommander/1.29/jcommander-1.29.jar



RUNNING:

If you have compiled MCPD and placed the dependencies correctly, simply run
mcpd.sh:

mcpd.sh --help



PARTIAL CODE BASES:

MCP Deobfuscate can be used on subsets of a code base, e.g. to deobfuscate or
reobfuscate only the interesting classes.  To ensure accuracy for inherited
names, you will need to create an inheritance file for the portions that will
not be included:

mcpd.sh --config deobf.srg --inheritance external.inh --infiles a.jar b.zip c.class

The inheritance file can then be used like so:

mcpd.sh --config deobf.srg --stored_inheritance external.inh another.inh --infiles d.jar e.zip f.class --outdir deobfuscated
